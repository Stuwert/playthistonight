I recently finished Cal Newport’s new book _A World Without Email_ and so far… I have mixed feelings. I think the book does an excellent job of explaining the primary challenges that face knowledge workers. It ties up the loose threads related to the costs of context switching and informational overload by connecting personal productivity costs to business productivity costs. It makes a clear point that overload it’s not something we can simply wave away with better personal processes.

He notes that so much of our discussion of productivity is framed in personal terms instead of business or systemic terms. He argues that from a business cultural perspective, our spirit of reinvention and experimentation is lacking when it comes to our workflow.


There are a few concepts I found most helpful in the book. Newport's term the **hyperactive hive mind** talks about the idea that companies have traded individual effectiveness for a sort of hive mind of knowledge that can act effectively, but slowly. He argues that this is bad because of something he calls the **attention capital principle**. His argument is that attention capital is our ability to turn information into value via focus.



## The Distinction Between Workflow and Work Execution 

I think part 1 of _A World Without Email_ is worth reading. It solidifies a lot of concepts around productivity and systemic thinking. Part 1 of the book deals with making these connections between how the human brain is wired to deal with socialization in specific ways, and how our modern information workflows become the worst of both worlds, feeling like we have to be always on and always responsive. In part 2, he starts talking about specific workflows, centered around software workflow concepts of scrum and agile, specific recommendations for how to structure work in uncertain environments. 

He wants to push back on the popular thinking that Peter Drucker articulated: the idea that all knowledge work must be autonomous. 

The end result he  But part 2 relies on a specific distinction that he draws between concepts he calls workflows and work execution.  In order to push back on the popular thinking of Peter Drucker, the man who articulated that knowledge work must be autonomous, 


Like Drucker, the separation of workflow and work value feels alluring. Workflow is basically the how we work together. Work function is the focus doing the work time. Newport argues that we can structure workflow work similarly to how we structure assembly lines while we allow pure freedom for the focused value add work. I think this is a fantastical idea that is born more from the concept that no one wants to be told how to do their work than an insight that workflow and work execution are separate components.

Let’s take software engineering as an example:

In Cal’s telling, there’s a clear delineation between “value producing work” i.e. the hands on keyboard coding, and the “workflow” work, i.e. code reviews. 

This sounds nice. Because as a developer having “focus time” is what you want from a maker perspective. But... there isn’t actually a clear line between heads down making and heads up reviewing work. It’s a best practice for every piece of code that gets committed to go through a “PR” (named for Pull Requests or Peer Reviews) process. This is an opportunity for other developers to take a look at the code and comment on any changes. The issue here is that we’ve quickly turned a “value add” function into a “workflow” function. The developer can’t continue with other work because they need a review, either they have to ping people to get answers or they have to start something else, potentially building new context before switching back.

One, very valid answer, is to decide to do “pair programming” or “mob programming”. This is a process where 2 or more developers (with various types of structure) will decide to work together to solve a problem. As Google’s standards say, if code is paired on, it doesn’t need to be reviewed because the review has been part of the process. This sounds great, but has turned a “workflow” problem in to a “value” problem. 

Take a similar issue with a junior engineer who might be new to the team. Often it’s important for them to work on their own so they build the types of research and problem solving skills that will serve them as they grow in their career. Often the advice is “if you get stuck for more than 30 minutes, seek help”. Cal would seem to frame this as an inconvenience issue. The junior engineer could wait for a senior to become available. But, having been on both sides of the pattern, often getting help in that moment is important. If the junior has to wait longer it can cause frustration to ruminate on why they’re unable to solve the problem, or spiraling through unhelpful paths that result in more work for the senior developer to help untangle. One potential solution is to pair, and that can be a valid solution, but it results in a change for the value creation proposition for everyone on the team.

I don’t think this is bad. I think in an environment where team work is important, the lines between workflow and value add are blurred. But, I do think it suggests that one of the principle challenges to knowledge work is that the negotiation of what on and off focus time looks like has to be different depending on the relationship between and individual and a team, and the team and the rest of the company.

## Narrowing Too Quickly



I think this is broadly true, but his use of Henry Ford and industrialists as the examples to follow is both concerning and not entirely helpful. The benefit to having a single central workflow deciding how best to flow information through a team can be effective for small companies or personal projects where the outcomes are well-articulated and everyone has an opportunity to give their input. 

At bigger companies, or even hyperactive startups, I think strict workflows start to fall apart. Often there’s a large gap between the interests of different segments of an organization. These gaps create inefficiencies more broadly, but are also a cause for the hyperactive hive mind. For example, at a startup we’d often receive a flood of bugs coming through the system. This created a values separation between the customer support team, for whom the resolution of bugs was tantamount, and the development team, who wanted to create a stable system but needed time to step back and understand the context. There’s an amount of nuance and compromise that’s necessary here.

There’s an impulse here to narrow in on a process solution. And it’s something we tried multiple times. The proximal outcome was hive mind, but a stricter process would not have solved the underlying problem. A Word Without Email talks about the challenges caused by Peter Drucker’s vision of a fully autonomous knowledge worker. The problems of this are well articulated. We can’t plug better workers in to solve a bad process. That will burn them out. 

In order to try to square this circle, Newport tries to separate out knowledge work into two component parts, workflow and value functions.

But I think he jumps from describing these problems to recommending a lot of specific workflows to resolve these issues. As someone who’s dealt with both kanban and scrum workflows that his recommendations are based off of.

## We Don't Plan Enough

The pronouncement here isn't for knowledge workers to implement simple queueing systems to take control over their days, it's for leadership and management to take a more active role in understanding who, how and when people in their organization communicate. _A World Without Email_ reframes communication as a competitive advantage. Getting it right means speed. 

But the solution to this is paradoxical, as the book mentions. In order to get that speed, we need to spend more time up front planning and coordinating goals for projects as well as the communication patterns we intend to use to execute them. 

Often when we conjure the issues with big companies we think of countless hours in meetings planning. But I would argue these meetings involve little actual planning. Instead of planning and researching we typically quickly move to decision and risk limiting. Given a direction, how can we make sure the product we want to build actually happens. 

This is where Henry Ford’s "spirit of innovation" could be productively injected into the system. Often we rush to jump to execution that we spend a small amount of time thinking about the what and the how. Leaders at every level should be thinking about how they can plan to clearly articulate what problem we are trying to solve, and then how to create a system that delivers the most autonomy possible to the smallest unit of work on a team.

The WOOP principle here is also helpful on a personal level. It’s a principle I learned about in the _Science of Happiness_ coursera course. 

The process is Wish Objective Obstacle Plan. Note a couple things here. First we don’t jump from Wish to Plan or even Wish to Objective. First we articulate our wish and then come up with a specific objective that will help us meet that wish. It concretizes our goal and zeros in on the problem we’re trying to solve. The obstacle phase works a lot like Newport envisions these productivity systems. Obstacles are communication patterns, issues, and touch points well have to work through to get there. And finally the plan: based on all of that information we can build up a concrete set of steps to get there.

I would argue that the issue isn’t the lack of a workflow, it’s the fact that we jump from wish to plan, skipping over the parts where we develop habits to think about how to work. This isn’t to say that each problem will be unique. Some may be the same or similar and as we build up a toolbox of workflows we can deploy them in the appropriate situation.
