_Ugly Gryphon Inn_ by Scott Almes is one of the newest Wallet Games in the Button Shy line. I've gotten fond of the inventiveness of the designs in these 18 card games. I've only played a couple of this so far, but I appreciate the balance between the systems and the upkeep. 

The game is simple. Each turn you choose someone in the "bar" and put them in the hotel, then you resolve each card's annoyances based on a couple of rules, and determine if you have any angry customers and leave. If you make it to the end of the deck without 8 customers leaving you win. It's concise concept that also represents the theme of running a successful hotel.
